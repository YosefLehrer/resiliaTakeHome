# Resilia Take Home

### Hi there Resilia team, happy new year!

Thank you for taking the time to review this assignment, I really appreciate it.
Before trying to test this project locally, please make sure you have Node.JS and NPM installed.
To get started, please clone this repository, `cd back-end/` and run `npm i && node server.js`. Then, in a new terminal run `cd front-end/` and run `npm i && npm start`. The project should now be running in http://localhost:3000.

I look forward to meeting you soon.
